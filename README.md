## Installation

Install via npm:

```bash
npm install @tmmc/animate-scss --save
```

## Compiling SASS to CSS
Use it as it comes (with all the animations included) or just comment out the ones you are not planning to use in `./src/sass/animate.scss` and run `npm run build`.

If you need wider range of supported browsers, change values in `browserslist` key in `package.json`.

## Usage with jQuery
There is also a script extending jQuery with short description in it how to use it: `./src/js/jquery-animate-css.js`.
